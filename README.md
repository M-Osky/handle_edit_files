# files_and_various
Miscelaneous scripts used to handle files, columns, rename, etc
Most of them are quite old and can be done with a simple one liner in perl, but may be useful for someone starting.

The more simple have a few lines explaining at the beginning, other have -help information

The only ons I still use in order to no have to come up with a one liner in Perl:

- popmap_maker: if you have files with the sample code and population code in their name it will make a popmap for you (file with sample ID and population code)
-
